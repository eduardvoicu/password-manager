# Password Manager & Generator
by Eduard Voicu

## User Story
```
AS a USER
I WANT to have a RANDOM password generated
SO THAT I can use it for any online account I want to make more secure.
```

```
This deployed app allows the user to create a unique random password by answering
a few yes or no questions to the type of stuff the user needs/wants. It allows the user
to select the length, lowercase/uppercase, special characters and numbers.
